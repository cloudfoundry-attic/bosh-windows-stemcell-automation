# BOSH Windows Stemcell Automation [![slack.cloudfoundry.org](https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudfoundry.org)

BOSH Windows stemcell automation is deprecated. The recommended approach for creating local  BOSH Windows stemcells which can be deployed on [Cloud Foundry BOSH](https://bosh.io),
is [`stembuild`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stembuild).

[Documentation on how to use `stembuild` can be found here.](https://bosh.io/docs/windows-stemcell-create/)
